# Chicago Skyline Towers detection using Tensorflow Object Detection!
Ever wondered what are the names of the towers by just looking at the beautiful scene of skyline in your closest city with skyscrapers? We always do when we sit alongside the Michigan lake’s shoreline to identify the skyscrapers in the beautiful city of Chicago.

Trust me! This is possible using Google’s Tensorflow Object Detection API which can be used to train a neural network to detect and track the objects of your choice in real-time. Yaaay! There could be many applications of this amazing functionality and tools of Tensorflow. We are going to show you how this can be achieved with minimal effort.
